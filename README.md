# Math Invaders

**Description:**
Math Invaders is an educational game that combines mathematical problem-solving with classic space invader gameplay. Players must solve mathematical equations to defeat invading aliens and prevent them from reaching the bottom of the screen.

**Requirements:**
- Python
- Pygame library
- Sympy library

**How to Play:**
1. Use the 'A' and 'D' keys to move your spaceship left and right.
2. Press the 'SPACE' key to shoot bullets and solve equations.
3. Solve the displayed equation by typing the answer in the input box.
4. Hit the aliens by firing bullets with correct answers to earn points.
5. Earn additional bullets by answering equations correctly.
6. Game over if an alien reaches the bottom or collides with your spaceship.

**Equations:**
The game presents a variety of linear equations for players to solve. Each equation has a unique correct answer, and players must input the correct solution to proceed.

**Scoring:**
- Successfully hitting an alien with a correct answer bullet earns points.
- Each correct equation solved adds extra bullets to your ammunition.

**Controls:**
- **A:** Move spaceship left
- **D:** Move spaceship right
- **SPACE:** Fire bullets to solve equations

**Game Over:**
If an alien collides with your spaceship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the game is over. The screen displays a "Game Over" message.

**Sound:**
- Background music ('music.mp3') plays continuously.
- Bullet firing sound ('bruh.mp3') plays when bullets are fired.
- Explosion sound ('explosion.mp3') plays when an alien is hit.

**Graphics:**
- Spaceship image: 'spaceship.png'
- Alien image: 'alien.png'
- Bullet image: 'bullet.png'

**External Libraries:**
- Pygame: Used for creating the game window, handling events, and rendering graphics.
- Sympy: Used for generating random linear equations and checking player answers.

**Acknowledgments:**
- Background music and sound effects by mixer.

**Note:**
Make sure to have the required libraries installed and the game assets (images, sounds) in the same directory as the Python script for the game to run successfully. You can install them by running `python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt` on Windows and `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt` on Mac/Linux.
